# ðŸ§  Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) ðŸš€

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The model is trained on the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-cnn.git
   cd deep-learning-cnn
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/cnn_training.ipynb
   ```

---

## Usage
### Running the Model
To run the model and train on the CIFAR-10 dataset, you can either use the Jupyter notebook (`cnn_training.ipynb`) or execute the following script directly:

```bash
python src/cnn_model.py
```

The training script will:
- Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Build the CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Train the model for 5 epochs.
- Save the trained model and plot the accuracy and loss curves.

---

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used in this project consists of the following layers:

1. **Conv2D Layer 1:** 32 filters, kernel size (3x3), activation: ReLU
2. **MaxPooling2D Layer 1:** Pool size (2x2)
3. **Conv2D Layer 2:** 64 filters, kernel size (3x3), activation: ReLU
4. **MaxPooling2D Layer 2:** Pool size (2x2)
5. **Conv2D Layer 3:** 64 filters, kernel size (3x3), activation: ReLU
6. **Flatten Layer:** Converts 3D feature maps into a 1D vector
7. **Dense Layer:** 64 neurons, activation: ReLU
8. **Output Layer:** 10 neurons (for 10 classes), activation: Softmax

---

## Results
After training the model for 5 epochs, here are the results:

- **Training Accuracy:** 63%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 62%
- **Test Accuracy:** 62.1%

### Accuracy and Loss Plots:
Accuracy and loss plots can be found in the `notebooks/cnn_training.ipynb`.

## Requirements
To run the models and notebooks, you'll need the following packages:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch (based on the implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-project-hub.git
   cd deep-learning-project-hub
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

---

## Usage
### Running Notebooks
Each project in this repository includes Jupyter notebooks that can be run directly. For example, to run the CNN classification notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/cnn_classification.ipynb
```

### Running Python Scripts
If you prefer running the Python scripts directly, you can execute them as follows:
```bash
python src/cnn_model.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the data.
- Train the model.
- Save the trained model and generate evaluation metrics.
